Project1 : Whatsapp Chat Analysis
WhatsApp Chat Analysis Project
This project analyzes WhatsApp chat data to perform text preprocessing, generate a word cloud, and conduct sentiment analysis using Python and various libraries such as NLTK, WordCloud, Matplotlib, and TextBlob.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to gain insights from WhatsApp conversations by:

Preprocessing the chat data to remove unnecessary metadata, special characters, and stopwords.
Visualizing the most frequent words using a word cloud.
Analyzing the overall sentiment of the conversation using TextBlob.
Project Structure
chat_analysis.py: Python script containing the code for preprocessing, word cloud generation, and sentiment analysis.
WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt: Sample WhatsApp chat data file used for analysis.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/)
Libraries:
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
wordcloud
matplotlib
textblob
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib textblob
Setup
Clone the Repository or download the chat_analysis.py script and the sample WhatsApp chat data file (WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt).

Install Python: If you haven't already, install Python from python.org and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.

Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib textblob
Download NLTK Data: After installing NLTK, download the NLTK data by running Python in your terminal:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Update File Path: Replace the chat variable (chat = '/content/drive/MyDrive/WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt') in chat_analysis.py with the path to your actual WhatsApp chat data file.

Running the Code
To execute the project, follow these steps:

Navigate to Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt.

Change Directory: Navigate to the directory containing chat_analysis.py and your WhatsApp chat data file.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/project/directory
Run the Script: Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python chat_analysis.py
View Results: The script will preprocess the chat data, generate a word cloud, perform sentiment analysis, and save the word cloud image (wordcloud.png) in the specified directory.

Detailed Explanation
Text Preprocessing
Cleaning Text: Removes unnecessary metadata (timestamps, etc.), special characters, and converts text to lowercase.

Tokenization: Splits text into individual words (tokens).

Stopword Removal: Removes common words that do not contribute to the overall meaning (e.g., "the", "and", "is").

Stemming: Reduces words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run") using Porter Stemmer.

Word Cloud Generation
WordCloud: Creates a visual representation of the most frequent words in the WhatsApp chat data using WordCloud library.

Visualization: Displays the word cloud using Matplotlib with customization options for color, size, and background.

Sentiment Analysis
TextBlob: Performs sentiment analysis on the preprocessed text using TextBlob library.

Sentiment Score: Calculates sentiment polarity score, where positive values indicate positive sentiment, negative values indicate negative sentiment, and values close to zero indicate neutral sentiment.

Output
Word Cloud Image: Saves the generated word cloud image (wordcloud.png) to the specified directory for visual inspection.

Sentiment Analysis Result: Prints the overall sentiment of the chat data as Positive, Negative, or Neutral along with the sentiment score.

Notes
Data Format: Ensure your WhatsApp chat data file (WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt) is correctly formatted and encoded (UTF-8 recommended) for proper processing.

Path Configuration: Adjust the file path and name in chat_analysis.py according to your local file system setup.

Language Considerations
Hinglish Language: Due to the presence of Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English) in the sample chat data, sentiment analysis results may vary. The algorithm may interpret sentiments differently, resulting in lower positive sentiment scores.

Potential Improvements
Interactive Visualization: Enhance the word cloud with interactive features using libraries like Plotly.

Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Explore more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques or models for nuanced understanding.

Real-time Analysis: Extend the project to analyze live WhatsApp chats using web scraping or API integration.

Project 2
Customer Segmentation 
Customer Segmentation Project for Cow and Buffalo Milk Company
Overview
This project focuses on enhancing sales strategy and optimizing advertising spend for Cow and Buffalo Milk company through effective customer segmentation. By analyzing merchant data, the project aims to identify distinct customer segments based on their purchasing behavior, annual revenue, and creditworthiness. This segmentation helps in targeting the right customers with tailored marketing strategies, thereby maximizing profitability and operational efficiency.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Merchant Id: Unique identifier for each merchant.
Annual Revenue: Annual income generated by the merchant.
Spending Score: Score indicating the spending behavior of the merchant.
City: Location where the merchant operates.
Most Purchased Product: The product that the merchant purchases the most from Cow and Buffalo Milk company.
Cluster Number: Resulting cluster label from the clustering algorithm.
Cluster Nature: Categorized nature of each cluster ('General', 'Careful', 'Spendthrift', 'Miser', 'Target').
Project Workflow
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
Data Loading and Inspection:

The dataset (analyzed.csv) is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for initial inspection.
Basic statistics and data information (shape, columns, data types) are examined using .info() and .describe() methods.
Missing values are checked and handled appropriately.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Distribution plots (distplot) are used to visualize the distributions of 'Annual Revenue' and 'Spending Score'.
Pair plots (pairplot) are generated to explore relationships between key features like 'Annual Revenue', 'Spending Score', and 'City'.
A correlation heatmap (heatmap) is created to identify correlations between numerical variables.
2. Clustering Analysis
K-means Clustering:

The KMeans algorithm is applied to segment merchants based on 'Annual Revenue' and 'Spending Score'.
The optimal number of clusters is determined using the elbow method, visualized with an inertia plot (Elbow Method).
Clusters are visualized using a scatter plot (Clusters of Customers) with centroids highlighted.
Cluster Labeling:

Each merchant is assigned a 'Cluster Nature' based on their Cluster Number:
'General': Stable purchasing patterns and high creditworthiness.
'Careful': Consistent and reliable purchasing behavior.
'Spendthrift': Erratic purchasing behavior despite high spending.
'Miser': Low spending with unpredictable purchasing behavior.
'Target': Potential high-value targets for focused marketing efforts.
3. Classification Model
Random Forest Classifier:
A Random Forest classifier is implemented to predict the 'Cluster Nature' for new merchants.
The model is trained using features like 'Annual Revenue', 'Spending Score', 'City', 'Most Purchased Product', and 'Cluster Number'.
Model performance metrics such as accuracy score and classification report (Classification Model) are computed to evaluate prediction accuracy.
4. Business Insights and Recommendations
Key Insights:

Identified customer segments ('Careful', 'General', 'Spendthrift', 'Miser', 'Target') and their characteristics.
Highlighted segments with higher creditworthiness ('Careful', 'General') for targeted advertising investments.
Cautioned against segments with unpredictable behaviors ('Spendthrift', 'Miser') to mitigate marketing risks.
Recommendations:

Tailor marketing strategies to align with the preferences and behaviors of 'Careful' and 'General' merchants.
Allocate advertising spend wisely by focusing on segments likely to yield higher returns.
Continuously monitor and update segmentation strategies based on changing market dynamics.
5. Output and Documentation
Final Output:
The analyzed dataset with cluster labels and predictions (finalised_data.csv) is saved for future reference and reporting.
Visualizations and summary tables provide clear insights into customer segmentation and business recommendations.
