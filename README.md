Project1 : Whatsapp Chat Analysis
WhatsApp Chat Analysis Project
This project analyzes WhatsApp chat data to perform text preprocessing, generate a word cloud, and conduct sentiment analysis using Python and various libraries such as NLTK, WordCloud, Matplotlib, and TextBlob.

Project Overview
The aim of this project is to gain insights from WhatsApp conversations by:

Preprocessing the chat data to remove unnecessary metadata, special characters, and stopwords.
Visualizing the most frequent words using a word cloud.
Analyzing the overall sentiment of the conversation using TextBlob.
Project Structure
chat_analysis.py: Python script containing the code for preprocessing, word cloud generation, and sentiment analysis.
WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt: Sample WhatsApp chat data file used for analysis.
Requirements
Ensure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x (https://www.python.org/)
Libraries:
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
wordcloud
matplotlib
textblob
Install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib textblob
Setup
Clone the Repository or download the chat_analysis.py script and the sample WhatsApp chat data file (WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt).

Install Python: If you haven't already, install Python from python.org and ensure it's added to your system's PATH.

Install Required Libraries: Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to install the necessary libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install nltk wordcloud matplotlib textblob
Download NLTK Data: After installing NLTK, download the NLTK data by running Python in your terminal:

python
Copy code
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('stopwords')
Update File Path: Replace the chat variable (chat = '/content/drive/MyDrive/WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt') in chat_analysis.py with the path to your actual WhatsApp chat data file.

Running the Code
To execute the project, follow these steps:

Navigate to Directory: Open a terminal or command prompt.

Change Directory: Navigate to the directory containing chat_analysis.py and your WhatsApp chat data file.

bash
Copy code
cd path/to/project/directory
Run the Script: Execute the Python script:

bash
Copy code
python chat_analysis.py
View Results: The script will preprocess the chat data, generate a word cloud, perform sentiment analysis, and save the word cloud image (wordcloud.png) in the specified directory.

Detailed Explanation
Text Preprocessing
Cleaning Text: Removes unnecessary metadata (timestamps, etc.), special characters, and converts text to lowercase.

Tokenization: Splits text into individual words (tokens).

Stopword Removal: Removes common words that do not contribute to the overall meaning (e.g., "the", "and", "is").

Stemming: Reduces words to their base or root form (e.g., "running" to "run") using Porter Stemmer.

Word Cloud Generation
WordCloud: Creates a visual representation of the most frequent words in the WhatsApp chat data using WordCloud library.

Visualization: Displays the word cloud using Matplotlib with customization options for color, size, and background.

Sentiment Analysis
TextBlob: Performs sentiment analysis on the preprocessed text using TextBlob library.

Sentiment Score: Calculates sentiment polarity score, where positive values indicate positive sentiment, negative values indicate negative sentiment, and values close to zero indicate neutral sentiment.

Output
Word Cloud Image: Saves the generated word cloud image (wordcloud.png) to the specified directory for visual inspection.

Sentiment Analysis Result: Prints the overall sentiment of the chat data as Positive, Negative, or Neutral along with the sentiment score.

Notes
Data Format: Ensure your WhatsApp chat data file (WhatsApp Chat with Kishan Bhai Personal.txt) is correctly formatted and encoded (UTF-8 recommended) for proper processing.

Path Configuration: Adjust the file path and name in chat_analysis.py according to your local file system setup.

Language Considerations
Hinglish Language: Due to the presence of Hinglish (a mix of Hindi and English) in the sample chat data, sentiment analysis results may vary. The algorithm may interpret sentiments differently, resulting in lower positive sentiment scores.

Potential Improvements
Interactive Visualization: Enhance the word cloud with interactive features using libraries like Plotly.

Advanced Sentiment Analysis: Explore more sophisticated sentiment analysis techniques or models for nuanced understanding.

Real-time Analysis: Extend the project to analyze live WhatsApp chats using web scraping or API integration.
